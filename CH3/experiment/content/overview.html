<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>In this simulation, we will be learning about some of the issues involving building statistical models of data and the relationships between variables.</p>
<p>A <strong>statistical model</strong> is a mathematical framework used to represent complex data through a set of statistical assumptions and equations. It describes the relationship between different variables by quantifying how <strong>independent variables</strong> (predictors) influence a <strong>dependent variables</strong> (outcomes). The goal of a statistical  model is to make inferences, predictions, or understand the underlying patterns within the data.</p>
<p>Key components of a statistical model include:
- <strong>Parameters</strong>: These are the coefficients or constants that the model uses to describe the relationship between variables.
- <strong>Variables</strong>: These are the quantities being studied, which can be either independent (predictors) or dependent (outcomes).
- <strong>Error term</strong>: This represents the randomness or noise in the model, accounting for the difference between the observed data and the values predicted by the model. A good statistical model balances complexity and simplicity, accurately capturing the essential features of the data while avoiding overfitting.</p>
