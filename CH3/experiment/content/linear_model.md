# Linear Model

### Example: y = mx + b (+ ϵ)

The simple equation for a line is an example of a model of a linear relationship between an independent variable (x) 
and a dependent variable (y). We call the slope (m) and the intercept (b) parameters, because they describe the 
relationship between x and y.

The error term (ϵ) is used to describe how much error there is when a specific set of parameter values is used
to model real data. For example, if our model of an x-y relationship was y = 2x + 1, then for the observed data point
(2,5), ϵ would be equal to 0, because there was no error in modeling the data. In other words, 2 * 2 + 1 = 5. If our
observed data point was (2,4), since the observed y-value of 4 is 1 less than the expected y-value (given the model) for 
the x-value of 2.
