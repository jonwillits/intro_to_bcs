# Overview

In this simulation, we will be learning about some of the issues involving building statistical models of data
and the relationships between variables.

A **statistical model** is a mathematical framework used to represent complex data through a 
set of statistical assumptions and equations. It describes the relationship between different variables by quantifying 
how **independent variables** (predictors) influence a **dependent variables** (outcomes). The goal of a statistical 
model is to make inferences, predictions, or understand the underlying patterns within the data.

Key components of a statistical model include:
- **Parameters**: These are the coefficients or constants that the model uses to describe the relationship between 
variables.


- **Variables**: These are the quantities being studied, which can be either independent (predictors) or 
dependent (outcomes).


- **Error term**: This represents the randomness or noise in the model, accounting for the difference between the
observed data and the values predicted by the model. A good statistical model balances complexity and simplicity, 
accurately capturing the essential features of the data while avoiding overfitting.

### Example: y = mx + b (+ ϵ)

The simple equation for a line is a model of a linear relationship between an independent variable (x) and a dependent 
variable (y). We call the slope (m) and the intercept (b) parameters, because they describe the relationship between 
x and y.

The error term (ϵ) is used to describe how much error there is when a specific set of parameter values is used
to model real data. For example, if our model of an x-y relationship was y = 2x + 1, then for the observed data point
(2,5), ϵ would be equal to 0, because there was no error in modeling the data. In other words, 2 * 2 + 1 = 5. If our
observed data point was (2,4), since the observed y-value of 4 is 1 less than the expected y-value (given the model) for 
the x-value of 2.
