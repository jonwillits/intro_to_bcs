# Overview

In this simulation, we will be learning about some of the issues involving building statistical models of data and the relationships between variables.

A **statistical model** is a mathematical framework used to represent complex data through a set of statistical assumptions and equations. It describes the relationship between different variables by quantifying how **independent variables** (predictors) influence a **dependent variables** (outcomes). The goal of a statistical  model is to make inferences, predictions, or understand the underlying patterns within the data.

Key components of a statistical model include:

- **Parameters**: These are the coefficients or constants that the model uses to describe the relationship between variables.
- **Variables**: These are the quantities being studied, which can be either independent (predictors) or dependent (outcomes).
- **Error term**: The variation not explained by the model, accounting for the difference between the observed data and the model's predictions.
