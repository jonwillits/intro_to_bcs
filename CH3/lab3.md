# Lab 3: Scientific Method in BCS

### 1. In your group, evaluate the law of effect example from the video “The Scientific Method”.
- What is an example of a hypothesis you can derive from this theory (the missing box in the slides)
- Does this theory meet the criteria we noted for a good scientific theory? Which does it meet, and on which does it fall short?
- How would you improve it in the ways that it falls short?
