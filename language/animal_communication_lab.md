# Language Lab: Nonhuman Animal Communication

---

## Overview

Human language is unique—but not entirely without precedent.  
Many other species communicate through vocal calls, gestures, dances, or chemical signals.  
By studying these systems, we can identify which features of communication we share with other animals, and which are uniquely human.

In this lab, you will:
1. Review **Hockett’s Design Features of Human Language.**  
2. Watch an approximately **~30-minute video** about one animal communication system.  
3. Analyze that system using Hockett’s framework.  
4. Reflect on how it compares to human language and what it reveals about language evolution.

## Preparation (no points, but required)
1. Read this page about [Hockett’s Design Features of Language](hockett_design_features.md).
2. Select **one** of the animals to focus on in this lab. Some have more than one video, but the totalvideo to watch (in class or independently). Possible examples include:  
time for each animal is about 30 minutes.
   - [How Do Insects Communicate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzMUZBicINk) 
   - [Barking and Marking: The Language of Dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj9igX-BMG8) 
   and [The Science Behind the Self Aware Dog Talking With Buttons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMPGDoXqNPM)
   and [Can This Self-Aware Dog Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBwT94a2DXU)
   - [Dolphin Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnhCUYvDHdU&t=95s) and [Could We Speak the Language of Dolphins?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ5dRyyHwfM)
   - [Kanzi, the Smartest Ape that Ever Lived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blzqnGky5Js&t=826s)

Take notes as you watch. 
Pay attention to **what signals are used**, **how they are produced**, and **what purposes they serve**.

## Part 1. Observation and Description (20 points total)
*(This section focuses on concrete details from the video.)*

**1. Describe the system. (4 pts)**  
What are the main **modalities of communication** used by this species (sound, gesture, visual display, chemical signal, etc.)?  
Provide one or two clear examples.

**2. Identify signal types. (4 pts)**  
List several **distinct signals** or behaviors the animals use to communicate (e.g., alarm calls, mating displays, dances, gestures).  
Briefly note what each one seems to mean or accomplish.

**3. Context and purpose. (4 pts)**  
When and why are these signals used?  
Do they seem to coordinate group behavior, attract mates, warn of danger, or express emotion?

**4. Learning vs. instinct. (4 pts)**  
What evidence from the video suggests that the communication system is **learned** rather than **innate**, or vice versa?  
Explain briefly.

**5. Audience awareness. (4 pts)**  
Is there evidence that the animal recognizes or monitors its **listener’s attention**—for instance, repeating or adjusting signals depending on whether others are watching or responding?

## Part 2. Applying Hockett’s Design Features (26 points total)
*(Now evaluate how closely the system resembles human language.)*

**6. Feature-by-feature analysis. (18 pts)**  
Select **six** of Hockett’s design features (e.g., semanticity, arbitrariness, displacement, productivity, cultural transmission, duality of patterning, etc.).  
For each, indicate whether there is **clear evidence**, **partial evidence**, or **no evidence** in your chosen species.  
Give a short explanation and one example from the video for each feature.  
*(~2–3 sentences per feature.)*

| Feature | Evidence? | Example / Explanation |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |

**7. Continuity and gaps. (4 pts)**  
Based on the video but also all that we've learned in this class, which of Hockett’s features appear **earliest** in evolution (most widely shared)?  
Which seem **uniquely human** based on your analysis?  
Explain your reasoning.

**8. Evolutionary insight. (4 pts)**  
Based on what you observed, what might this communication system tell us about the **evolutionary precursors** of language?  
What cognitive or social pressures might have favored these abilities?

## Part 3. Clever Hans and Interpretation (6 points total)

### Background

In the early 1900s, a horse named **Clever Hans** appeared to perform arithmetic and understand language.  
Later research showed Hans was not doing math; he was responding to **subtle, unconscious human cues** (posture, breathing, head movements).  
[Watch this short (3 min) video about Clever Hans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAJlAuEo7Ac).

This case warns researchers:  
> Apparent communication may reflect **cue-reading**, not true understanding.

**9. Clever Hans evaluation. (6 pts)**  
Consider whether the communication shown in your video could be explained by a Clever Hans-style effect. Answer BOTH parts:

a) **Explain the Clever Hans problem in your own words** and why it matters for animal communication research. (2–3 sentences)  
b) **Does the video convincingly rule out** cue-based responding as the explanation?  
- Cite specific moments or methods (e.g., double-blind testing, no human present, spontaneous signals in the wild).
- If not fully ruled out, explain what evidence would be needed.

## Part 4. Comparison and Reflection (28 points total)
*(This section connects your observations to broader course concepts.)*

**10. Human comparison. (6 pts)**  
In what ways is this animal’s communication system **similar to human language**, and in what ways is it **different** in structure, flexibility, or purpose?  
Give at least two points of comparison.

**11. Cognitive requirements. (6 pts)**  
What **mental abilities** would the animal need in order to use this communication system effectively (e.g., memory, imitation, attention, planning, social understanding)?  
Provide evidence from the video.

**12. Marr’s Levels connection. (10 pts)**  
Using Marr’s framework, analyze this communication system at the three levels:  
- **Functional level:** What *adaptive problem* does this communication system solve for the species?  
- **Algorithmic level:** What *representations or rules* might the animal be using to generate and interpret signals?  
- **Implementational level:** What *anatomical or neural features* likely make this possible (e.g., vocal tract, brain specialization, sensory structures)?  
Write 1–2 sentences for each level.

**13. Critical reflection. (6 pts)**  
Hockett’s list was written in the 1960s. Based on what you saw, do you think his features **fully capture what makes human language unique**?  
Are there **social or cognitive capacities** (such as shared attention, imitation, or cultural teaching) that go beyond his framework?  
Explain your view.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit your answers as a single document (PDF or .docx).  
- Write in complete sentences, using examples and evidence from your chosen video.  
- You may work in pairs or small groups for observation, but **each student must submit their own written answers** in their own words.  
- Include the **title of your chosen video** at the top of your assignment.
