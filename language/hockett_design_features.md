## Background: Hockett’s Design Features of Human Language

In the 1960s, the linguist Charles Hockett set out to describe what makes human language different from other forms of animal communication. He proposed a list of “design features”—properties that, taken together, characterize human language as a unique system for symbolic communication. Some of these features are shared with other species, while others appear to be uniquely human.

Hockett’s goal wasn’t to rank species, but to identify the ingredients that had to evolve for full language to emerge.  
Studying which features are present or absent in other animals helps scientists trace the evolutionary path from emotional signaling and calls to the flexible, creative, and symbolic system humans use today.  
His framework is still widely used for comparing communication systems because it bridges biology, cognition, and culture—linking what we can do with language to how those abilities might have arisen.

### Hockett’s Major Design Features

| **Feature** | **Definition** | **Example in Human Language** |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Vocal–Auditory Channel** | Language is typically spoken and heard (though sign languages show that other modalities can work too). | Speech transmitted through air and heard by ears. |
| **Broadcast Transmission & Directional Reception** | Speech radiates outward but listeners can locate its source. | You can tell who is talking in a room by turning toward their voice. |
| **Rapid Fading (Transitoriness)** | Spoken signals fade quickly once produced. | Words vanish after you say them unless recorded. |
| **Interchangeability** | Speakers can both send and receive the same kinds of messages. | Any adult can say what they can understand. |
| **Total Feedback** | Speakers can hear and monitor their own speech. | You notice when you mispronounce a word. |
| **Specialization** | Speech sounds are produced primarily for communication, not other bodily functions. | Mouth movements in speech serve meaning, not eating. |
| **Semanticity** | Specific sounds or signs have specific meanings. | The word *dog* refers to a category of animals. |
| **Arbitrariness** | The link between signal and meaning is conventional, not natural. | There’s nothing “dog-like” about the sound *dog*. |
| **Discreteness** | Language uses distinct, separable units that can be recombined. | The difference between *bat* and *pat* lies in one sound unit. |
| **Displacement** | Ability to refer to things not present in time or space. | Talking about dinosaurs or tomorrow’s plans. |
| **Productivity (Open-Endedness)** | Ability to create and understand entirely new utterances. | Inventing a new sentence you’ve never heard before. |
| **Traditional (Cultural) Transmission** | Language is learned socially, not genetically fixed. | Children acquire their community’s language through interaction. |
| **Duality of Patterning** | Meaningless units (sounds) combine into meaningful ones (words), which combine into larger structures (sentences). | *k*, *æ*, *t* → *cat* → *The cat slept.* |
| **Prevarication** | Ability to lie or say things known to be false. | “I didn’t eat the cookie.” |
| **Reflexiveness** | Ability to use language to talk about language. | “The word *run* has many meanings.” |
| **Learnability** | Speakers of one language can learn another. | Learning Spanish after growing up with English. |


This list provides a diagnostic toolkit: by checking which features an animal system shows, we can infer how far along the evolutionary continuum toward human-like language it may be—and what cognitive or social capacities had to evolve to make true language possible.
