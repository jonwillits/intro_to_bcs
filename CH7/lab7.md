# Lab 7: The Cognitive Revolution

## 1. Computers and Cognition (10 PTS TOTAL)
Many behaviorists were fiercely resistant to theories that contained elements that were not directly measurable and observable, and this included things like ideas, beliefs, feelings, and knowledge. The invention of the computer convinced many new psychologists, and even many old behaviorists, that these kinds of things were ok to put into their theories of the mind.
- List as many reasons as you can think of why the computer may have led people to change their minds about this. (5)
- Can you think of other examples of where technological change has influenced ways that we think about or talk about the mind? (5)

## 2. The magical number 7 (plus or minus 2). (25 POINTS TOTAL)
- Explain the magical number 7 (plus or minus 2). (5)
- What is chunking, and how does it affect the size of your short term memory capacity? (5)
- What are three examples of chunking in everyday life, where chunks allow you to remember more information than you otherwise could? (5)
- Why was this discovery influential in convincing scientists that, contrary to the claims of behaviorism, it was possible to study the mind scientifically? (5)
- What is a way you could use chunking to help yourself when studying for your classes? (5)

## 3. The following questions all come from the experiment we took in class

In the experiment there were three different study lists: 1) images, 2) words, and 3) nonwords.
For each stimulus type, you were shown a study list of 20 items.
Then you were shown a test list.
The test list contained 10 "old" items from your study list, and 10 "new" items.
Your job was to guess, as quickly and accurately as possible, whether the item was "old" or "new".

### 3.1. Describe your experience (5 POINTS TOTAL)
- Which of the three kinds of stimuli was the easiest? Which was the hardest? (2 PTS)
- Why do you think that was? (3 PTS)

### 3.2. Experimental hypotheses (15 POINTS TOTAL)
After hearing about the three hypotheses, state your opinion about whether each hypothesis is true or not. Explain why.

- Hypothesis 1: (5 PTS)
- Hypothesis 2: (5 PTS)
- Hypothesis 3: (5 PTS)

### 3.3. Results (15 POINTS TOTAL)
After seeing the results from the experiment, decide whether there was evidence to support each hypothesis. Explain why.

- Hypothesis 1: (5 PTS)
- Hypothesis 2: (5 PTS)
- Hypothesis 3: (5 PTS)

### 3.4. Interpreting the results (20 PTS TOTAL)
Cognitive psychology is about trying to propose a theory about how information is processed:
- What kinds of information are stored (what "mental representations" are used)
- What mental processes or functions are used to process that information.

In your group, talk about what mental processes and representations are suggested by this experiment.
- What kind of information is your mind perceiving, storing, and using? (10 PTS)
- What processes are necessary to explain our results? (10 PTS)

### 3.5. Kinds of Memory (10 PTS)
After discussing with your TA about different kinds of memory proposed by cognitive psychologists, 
talk about how those ideas might help explain our results.
