# Spatial Cognition Lab
In this lab, you’ll explore how humans represent and update spatial information.
You’ll test your own (or a partner’s) ability to recall object locations after movement or rotation, 
and examine whether you rely on an egocentric (self-centered) or allocentric (world-centered) frame of reference.

This activity mirrors the classical research questions asked by psychologists like Tolman 
and neuroscientists studying place and grid cells — but at a human behavioral level.

### Part 1: Encoding a Scene
At the end of these instructions, you are going to click the link at the bottom and view Picture 1, 
a picture of a room with a bunch of objects in it. 
Before doing so, make sure you have some way to measure time in seconds.
You are going to look at the picture for precisely 30 seconds.
Before you start, take out a piece of paper and a writing instrument. 
You are going to try to recreate the image from memory.
When ready:
- right click (or hold your Control key while clicking) to open the link in a new browser window or tab.
- Start your timer, and study the picture carefully for exactly 30 seconds.
- After 30 seconds, close the window or browser tab.
- Count backwards from 60 to 0 by 3's (60, 57, 54, ...). This is an interference task, designed to keep you from
rehearsing the information in your working memory, and to force you to use your long term memory.
- Pick up your writing utensil and try to recreate the image as well as you can, 
all the objects and their relative locations.

When you are done trying to recreate Picture 1, answer the following questions:
1. How did you do? What kinds of mistakes did you make?
2. When memorizing the layout, did you think of it from an egocentric or allocentric perspective?
Explain how you could have used each kind of strategy in this task.
3. How accurate where your relative distances between all the objects?
Based on things we discussed in Lecture 2,
what does your accuracy suggest to you about the way you were storing the information?
4. What else can you say about the strategy that you used?

### Part 2: Scene Memory Task
Now, you are going to look at a new Picture where some things from Picture 1 will have changed.
You will need to try to notice as many changes as you can. When you are ready:
- Cover or turn over your drawing of Picture 1.
- Open Picture 1 in a new window or tab, and look at it for 30 seconds again, and then close the window.
- Once again, count backwards from 60 to 0 by 3's (60, 57, 54, ...)
- Then, click on the following link to look at Picture 2, and answer the following questions.

[Picture 2](picture2.jpeg)

You can keep Picture 2 open, but do not look at Picture 1 or your drawing of it.
1. Using only your memory, how has the Picture 2 changed from Picture 1?
Describe the changes in as much detail as you can.
2. After you're done, describe what thinking process you used to try to remember the differences.
3. Now open both Picture 1 and Picture 2 at the same time and compare them directly.
Describe what you felt your mind doing as you compared the two pictures when you were looking right at them.
In what way was your process similar to, and different from, what you did when you tried to compare them by memory?
4. How accurate was your memory-based description of how Picture 2 was different from Picture 1?
What kinds of mistakes did you make?

Now:
- close Picture 1 and cover your drawing of it.
- Open a new tab with Picture 2 again, and study it closely for 30 seconds.
- Then, close Picture 1 and count backwards from 60 to 0 by 3's (60, 57, 54, ...)
- Finally, open Picture 3 in a new tab. Keep it open an answer the following questions.

5. Using only your memory, how has the Picture 3 changed from Picture 2?
Describe the changes in as much detail as you can.
6. After you're done, describe what thinking process you used to try to remember the differences.
7. Now look at Picture 3 again. Compare it to Picture 2.
8. Describe what you felt your mind doing as you compared the two pictures when you were looking right at them.
In what way was your process similar to, and different from, what you did when you tried to compare them by memory? 
9. How accurate was your memory for the changes? What kinds of mistakes did you make? 
10. How did your success and process on Picture 3 vs. 2 differ from Picture 2 vs. 1?”
11. Using all you have written and thought about so far, what do your strategies, successes, and failures tell you 
about what kind of mental representations or processes you were using to remember and judge the differences.
Try to use concepts from the reading or lectures (such as Recalibration loop, landmarks, and hierarchical structure).
12. In particular, do you think you were using egocentric coding, allocentric coding, or a mix of both on this task? Why?

### Part 3: Mental Transformation Task
In Part 3, instead of trying to compare a picture to your memory, you are going to try to imagine how a picture
will change.
- Get a new piece of paper (or turn over the piece of paper you used to draw Picture 1 and use the back).
- Close Picture 1 and 2, and open Picture 3 in a new tab or window.
- Study Picture 3 for 30 seconds.
- Then, close Picture 3 and count backwards from 60 to 0 by 3's (60, 57, 54, ...)
- Now, imagine you are looking at Picture 3 from the other side, as if you walked to the other side of the image
and turned around, facing it from the other side.
From memory and using your imagination, try to draw the 180 degree rotated version of Picture 3.
When you are done, answer the following questions.

1. Describe the mental steps or experience you had trying to do this.
2. Re-open Picture 3, and compare it to your drawing.
How did you do? What did you get right, and what kind of mistakes did you make.
3. Did you find this easier or harder than what you were doing in Part 2?
4. What did your mistakes, change in strategy, and change in difficulty tell you about how your mind might
have done the imagination task differently from the memory task?
Try to use as many concepts from our readings and lectures as you can in your explanation. 
5. Did you form a “cognitive map” of your workspace in Tolman’s sense? 
What evidence supports that — shortcuts, relational memory, flexibility? 
6. How might hippocampal place and grid cells support the behaviors you observed?
Which cues (movement, vision, feedback) seemed most important for recalibrating your internal map? 
7. If we repeated this experiment in virtual reality with distorted landmarks or delayed feedback, 
what predictions would you make about performance and bias?
