# Lab 4: Evolution of Neurons

In this lab, you’ll explore how neurons evolved, how they work, and how they give rise to behavior. 
You’ll connect the logic of natural selection to neural evolution, 
examine how neurons transmit information, link neurotransmitters to real-life behavior, 
and compare different information-processing systems. 
Finally, you’ll design a simple nervous system that builds on what you learned in our vehicle lab.

### Part 1: The Logic of Natural Selection (15 pts)

Natural selection requires three components: variation, inheritance, and selection.

1. Define each component in your own words. (6 pts — 2 each)
2. Give one concrete example of how these three factors combined to influence the evolution of neurons in animals. (6 pts — 2 each)
3. Expand your example by discussing, for each component, what would happen to neural evolution if that component were missing. (3 pts — 1 each)

### Part 2: Action Potentials (15 pts)

Neurons don’t send “weak” or “strong” signals. They send all-or-nothing action potentials (spikes).
1. Explain why the all-or-nothing nature of spikes is important for communication across long axons. (5 pts)
2. Imagine if neurons could only send weak signals that faded over distance. Describe two specific ways this would limit animal behavior. (6 pts — 3 each)
3. Why does having a fast, reliable signaling system matter for survival in animals? (4 pts)

### Part 3: Neurotransmitters and Real-Life Behavior (15 pts)

Neurotransmitters are the chemicals neurons use to communicate. They can excite, inhibit, or modulate activity.

1. Define the following neurotransmitters and classify them as excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory: glutamate, GABA, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine. (10 pts — 2 each)
2. For each neurotransmitter, describe one real-life situation (from everyday life, or human biology, or worm/animal behavior) where it plays an important role. (5 pts — 1 eacg)

### Part 4: Information Flow Analogies (15 pts)

Biological systems process information in multiple ways. Compare three systems:
- Cells (central dogma): DNA → RNA → Protein
- Single neurons: Dendrites → Soma → Axon → Synapse
- Whole nervous systems/organisms: Inputs (senses) → Processing (neural circuits) → Outputs (behavior)

1. Draw or diagram the flow of information for each of the three systems. (6 pts — 2 each)
2. For each system, describe the inputs, outputs, and kind of information being processed. (6 pts — 2 each)
3. In 2–3 sentences, explain one key similarity and one key difference across the three systems. (3 pts)

### Part 5: Designing a Nervous System (20 pts)

In Lab 1, you worked with Vehicle 2. 
Now imagine an organism with a slightly more advanced nervous system that can track an internal state 
(“Am I too hot or too cold?”) and move accordingly.

1. Draw a simple wiring diagram showing how sensors, neurons, and effectors (motors) could work together in this system. (8 pts)
2. Describe in words how the system would function: what inputs it detects, how it integrates them, and what outputs it produces. (6 pts)
3. Explain how your design goes beyond Vehicle 2’s simple wiring, and what new behaviors it makes possible. (6 pts)
