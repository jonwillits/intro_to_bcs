### 1. Some philosophers have proposed that knowledge has three properties:
- a belief,
- that is true, and
- which is justified (meaning that you have good reasons to believe it).


Discuss in your group whether the scenarios described below constitute knowledge, according to that definition. Write down your consensus and your reasons for saying so. 

- Imagine I tell you, right before a basketball game begins, that the final score will be 89-82. 
In addition I tell you how many points each player will score. 
Imagine that it turns out I am 100% correct in every regard. 
According to the definition above, did I have “knowledge” of the event? Why or why not? 

- A four-year-old child who, when asked, says a bat is a mammal because bats have fur and that all mammals have fur. 

- Your belief about whether the earth goes around the sun knowledge? How do you know?

### 2. The “Epistemology” video discussed the difference between rationalism and empiricism. 

a. In the table below, fill in the blank cells. As the semester goes on, we are going to revisit and add to this table, so get to know it well. 
|         | Ratiolnalism | Empirciism |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Definition |?|?|
| Characteristic Features, Properties, or Beliefs  |?|?|

b. Plato and Aristotle were described as examples of the first empiricist and rationalist. According to the video, What beliefs or arguments did they have or make for their position? 

c.   Pick a very talented person with whom everyone in your group is familiar. What makes this person very talented? Do you think the person’s talents provide evidence for either the Rationalist or Empiricist perspective of the nature of knowledge? What are some arguments in favor and against both positions?

### 3. For the two arguments below, explicate each argument as a list of numbered premises and ending in the argument’s conclusion. Then diagram each argument, showing which claims depend on which other claims. In the course of making the diagram, you may notice that one or both arguments have implicit (unstated) premises. Add them to the argument. Note: in Microsoft word, you can use “Insert Shapes” to draw the diagram. 

a. The mind and the brain are not identical. How can things be identical if they have different properties? There is a property that the mind and brain do not share: the brain is divisible, but the mind is not. Like all material things, the brain can be divided into parts—different halves, regions, neurons, etc. But the mind is a unity. It is my thinking essence, in which I can discern no separate parts. 

b. It is immoral to eat animals for food because it is wrong to cause an animal to suffer pain when we could eat something that wouldn’t suffer instead. It is also immoral because of the environmental consequences. 15% of greenhouse gas emissions come from meat production, and 1 lb of beef requires 20 lbs of plant feed and 2000 gallons of water to produce.

### 4. Give examples of arguments that have each of the following properties: 
- Sound 
- Valid, and has at least one false premise and a false conclusion 
- Valid, and has at least one false premise and a true conclusion 
- Invalid, and has at least one false premise and a false conclusion 
- Invalid, and has at least one false premise and a true conclusion 
- Invalid, and has true premises and a true conclusion 
- Invalid, and has true premises and a false conclusion 
- Strong, but invalid [Hint: Think about inductive arguments.]

### 5. A truth table is a way that we can express all possible conditions of a set of propositions, and use it to evaluate the truth of more complex expressions. For example, we can make a truth table for the proposition “It is true that A and it is true that B”, by enumerating all possible combinations of A and B, as well as the resulting truth of the conjunction “A and B”. Complete the missing cells in the truth tables below. Reminder from the reading: the symbol "Λ" is used to mean "and", the symbol "ν" is used to mean "or, and the symbol "->" is used to mean (if, then).
|    A     | B | A ^ |
|---------|---------|---------|
| F |F|?|
| F |T|?|
| T |F|?|
| T |T|?|
