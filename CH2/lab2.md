1. Some philosophers have proposed that knowledge has three properties:
- a belief,
- that is true, and
- which is justified (meaning that you have good reasons to believe it).

  Discuss in your group whether the scenarios described below constitute knowledge, according to that definition. Write down your consensus and your reasons for saying so. 

- Imagine I tell you, right before a basketball game begins, that the final score will be 89-82. 
In addition I tell you how many points each player will score. 
Imagine that it turns out I am 100% correct in every regard. 
According to the definition above, did I have “knowledge” of the event? Why or why not? 

- A four-year-old child who, when asked, says a bat is a mammal because bats have fur and that all mammals have fur. 

- Your belief about whether the earth goes around the sun knowledge? How do you know?
