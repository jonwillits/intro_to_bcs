# Lab 12: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

## 1. What is Intelligence? (15 PTS TOTAL)
- Without conversing about it first, have each person in your group define intelligence. (3 PTS)
- Now discuss your answers as a group. Produce a definition with which you all agree. (2 PTS)
- What is the difference between intelligence and mind? Define “mind” and then compare your definitions. (5 PTS)
- Does the definition of intelligence depend on whether we are talking about humans, animals, or artificial entities? (5 PTS)

## 2. General Intelligence (25 PTS TOTAL)
Take 5 questions from the IQ test at: https://cerebrum-iq.com/quiz.
What do you think that is actually testing? What skills or abilities do you need to be good at this? (5 PTS)

Think about it from the perspectives we have considered in this class so far:
- symbolic perspective
- connectionist perspective
From these perspectives, what would it mean to be good at an IQ test? (10 PTS)
How would each perspective explain that that general intelligence would explain other abilities like having a good memory, or having good spatial or verbal skills. (10 PTS)

## 3. Symbolic Image Classification (15 PTS TOTAL)
- Come up with a set of rules to classify the images shown to you. What are your rules? (5 PTS)
- Now test your rules on the test images. 
  - How did your rules do? What did they leave out? (5 PTS)
  - What general conclusions can you draw from this attempt? (5 PTS)

## 4. Machine Learning (45 PTS TOTAL)

### 4.1. Examples
Other than the examples given in lecture, think of another example of:
- Supervised learning (5 PTS)
- Unsupervised learning (5 PTS)

### 4.2. Other Kinds of ML
- Is reinforcement learning (learning through reward and punishment) more like supervised or unsupervised learning? Why? (5 PTS)
- Is a recurrent neural network (a network that learns to predict sequences of inputs) more like supervised or unsupervised learning? Why? (5 PTS)

### 4.3. Computational Theories of Mind
Now think about some of the “Computational Theories of Mind” we have discussed so far this semester  
What is the relationship of each one of these to supervised learning and unsupervised learning? 
In what ways is each computational theory of mind similar and different to each kind of learning?
- Behaviorism (5 PTS)
- Symbolic Cognition (5 PTS)
- Neural Networks (5 PTS)

### 4.4. Which is Best?
For the symbolic and the connectionist perspective,
what is the best argument for, and best argument against, 
each perspective as most likely to lead to artificial general intelligence. (10 PTS)
