- unconditioned response (UR) (2 PTS)
- conditioned stimulus (CS) (2 PTS)
- conditioned response (CR) (2 PTS)

### 2.3. For the scene that is operant conditioning, which of the followiing does it demonstrate (2 POINTS), and why? (6 POINTS)
- positive reinforcement
- positive punishment
- negative reinforcement
- negative punishment

### 2.4. Are the scenes from “The Big Bang Theory” demonstrating operant conditioning or classical conditioning? (2 PTS)

### 2.5. Based on your answer to 2.4, label the parts and explain the way you did for either 2.2 or 2.3 (8 POINTS)
