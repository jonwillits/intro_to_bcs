# Lab: Logic

In this lab, we are going to think like cognitive scientists who want to understand how people reason.
Just as scientists design experiments to test hypotheses, we can treat arguments like “data” and test whether they really support their conclusions.
We’ll take a messy, everyday argument, clean it up into a logical form, and then use tools like truth tables, hidden premises, and consistency checks to evaluate it.
By the end, you’ll see how logic gives us a systematic way to separate good reasoning from flawed reasoning, and how this connects to how people actually think.

### Part 1: Identifying and Diagramming Arguments (20 pts)

In part 1, we are going to take a messy argument, determine its premises and conclusion, and label 
the parts.

    Look, everyone knows animals have feelings, and they definitely suffer when we treat them badly. 
    And I mean, obviously, hurting things that feel pain just isn’t right — it’s cruel and immoral. 
    So, honestly, when people kick dogs around or cram chickens into tiny cages, that’s just wrong.”

1.1 List each premise and the conclusion clearly (5 pts)

1.2 Diagram the argument structure (premises → conclusion), showing whether premises are independent, dependent, or joint (8 pts)

1.3. Sometimes arguments in the real world contain what are called "hidden" premises. 
Hidden premises are unstated joint or dependent premises.
In other words, one of the premises is really depending on some other premises that is being assumed but not explicitly stated.  
In the argument above, identify one hidden premise that makes the argument valid, and explain why it is needed. (7 pts)

### Part 2: Evaluating Argument Validity (20 pts)

2.1 Translate the animal treatment argument into propositional form (define P, Q, etc.) (6 pts)

2.2 Construct a truth table for the argument in propositional form. Highlight the “critical row(s)” where all premises are true (8 pts)

2.3 State whether the argument is valid or invalid, and explain why in 1–2 sentences (6 pts)

### Part 3: Soundness and Questionable Premises (10 pts)

3.1 Which of the premises in the animal treatment argument might be questionable in truth? Briefly explain why (5 pts)

3.2 Explain the difference between an argument being valid and an argument being sound, using this example (5 pts)

### Part 4: Consistency (15 PTS)

Consider a second argument:
- **Premise 1**: If treating animals badly helps humans survive, then it is morally acceptable.
- **Premise 2**: Treating animals badly helps humans survive.
- **Conclusion**: Treating animals badly is morally acceptable.

4.1. Write this second argument in propositional form (6 pts)

4.2. Are the two arguments (the original and the second) logically consistent with one another? How would you go about showing this using formal logical methods? (You don’t have to complete it, just describe how you would.) (9 pts)

### Part 5: Reflection on Cognitive Science Relevance (15 PTS)
5.1 Why is it important for cognitive scientists to distinguish validity from soundness when studying human reasoning? (7 pts)

5.2 How does testing for consistency or implication help us model belief systems and identify reasoning errors in real people? (8 pts)
