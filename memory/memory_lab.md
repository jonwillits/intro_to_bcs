# Lab: Memory, Generative Models, and Simulation
This week’s themes: reconstructive memory; imagination/simulation; semantic vs episodic memory; and
category learning.

## Format & collaboration
- You may work solo or in pairs/triads. 
- Every student must record and submit their own data and answers, and list who their group members were if any.
- Identical results submitted for the whole group will not receive full credit.
- Write neatly. 
- When pooling across a group (when invited), report both your individual numbers and the group average.
- Submit one .pdf or .docx per student)

## Timing (suggested; 60–75 min total):
- Part 1 (12 min),Part 2 (12 min), Part 3 (20–25 min), Part 4 (18–20 min).

## Part 1: Reconstructive Memory and Schema-Based Recall (45 PTS)
- Goal. Measure how prior knowledge about a context can help and hurt memory.
- Materials: Photo (provided), 30-item checklist (provided), timer.
- Please do each part of the experiment without reading on until you ar told to do so.

### Do the Experiment (5 PTS)
Procedure (solo or with partner):
- Create your lab document (a docx file or text file) and write "Part 1. Question 1: Memory responses".
Each member of your group should do this separately.
- Study the Study Photo for 30 seconds. 
- Close the photo.
- Do the distractor Task, counting backwards by 3s from 180) for 1 minute. 
- AFTER completing the distractor task, you will open the Recognition Checklist.
Copy the list of items into your lab report. For each item on the list, write two numbers:
  - A 1 or a 0 if you think that object was Present or Absent in the photo
  - A confidence rating for how sure you are (1 = guessing, 2 = think maybe it was there, 
  3 = pretty sure it was there, 4 = very sure it was there).
  - Finish rating all items on the Recognition Checklist before moving on to the Data Analysis part.

When you are ready:
- [Study Photo](office.jpeg) for 30 seconds
- Distractor Task
- [Recognition Checklist](recognition_checklist.md)

### Data Analysis
Now we will analyze your data. The checklist mixed four item types:
1. TC: True schema-consistent (really present, typical for offices)
2. TI: True schema-inconsistent (really present, atypical for offices)
3. FC: False schema-consistent lures (not present, typical for offices)
4. FI: False schema-inconsistent lures (not present, atypical for offices)
Calculate your percentage correct on all four of these conditions using the [Recognition Answers](recognition_answers.md).

Fill this table from your checklist marks (one row per item type) and put it in
your Lab Report as Part 1, Question 2. You may need to refer back to the week about 
pattern recognition if you need a refresher on some of these terms.  (10 PTS)

| Condition  | Count | Hits | Misses | Correct Rejections | False Alarms  |
|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|:------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|
|     TC     |       |      |        |        ---         |      ---      |
|     TI     |       |      |        |        ---         |      ---      |
|     FC     |       | ---  |  ---   |                    |               |
|     FI     |       | ---  |  ---   |                    |               |

### Interpret Your Results
- Q3. Describe the pattern of results. Do they make sense to you?  (5 PTS)
- Q4. Compare false alarm rates for schema-consistent vs schema-inconsistent lures.
Which is higher, and why might that be?  (5 PTS)
- Q5. Did high confidence correspond to greater accuracy?  (5 PTS)
Answer the question quantitatively, by comparing the average confidence in at least two situations.
- Q6. If we warned participants ahead of time that “typical office items might be missing,” 
how do you predict hit and FA rates would change, and why?  (5 PTS)
- Q7. A skeptic says you didn't use your episodic memory at all. You just used your semantic memory.
What might they mean by this? Do you think your data supports or doesn't support that claim? (5 PTS)
- Q8. This experiment is typically an experiment that demonstrates evidence that memory is reconstructive.
What does that mean, and why might that be? Is your data consistent with the idea? (5 PTS)

## Part 2: Organization in Memory (35 PTS)

### Procedure
You are going to do two memory tests on lists of words.
Get out your phone or some other method of timing exactly 60 seconds.
Have a piece of paper ready to write down the words you remember.
When you are ready, follow these instructions.
- Set your timer for 60 seconds and hit start
- Click on [List 1](list1.md) and study the list until the timer runs out.
- Close List 1.
- Count backwards from 60 to 0 by 3's.
- Set your timer for 60 seconds again, and press start.
- Write down as many of the words as you can remember until the timer runs out.

When you are all done, repeat the experiment with list 2.
- Set your timer for 60 seconds and hit start
- Click on [List 2](list2.md) and study the list until the timer runs out.
- Close List 1.
- Count backwards from 60 to 0 by 3's.
- Set your timer for 60 seconds again, and press start.
- Write down as many of the words as you can remember until the timer runs out.

### Analyze your results
Open list 1 and list 2 again, and count up how many of the words you correctly remembered.
- Q1: How many hits, misses, correct rejections and false alarms did you have on each list?
Calculate your hit rate: hits / (hits + misses). 
Calculate your false alarm rate: false alarms / (false alarms + correct rejections) (10 PTS)
- Q2: Was your hit rate and false alarm rate different for the two lists?
If we did this across many participants, we would typically see a much higher hit rate on list 2, but also a 
slightly higher false alarm rate. Why does this make sense? (10 PTS)
- Q3: As you probably noticed in list 2, the words all came from a set of 6 categories.
This was true of the words in list 1 as well.
We are going to compare how this affected your responses.
Count how many of the words you said were said immediately after another word from the same category. 
What was the total number of times a response came after another of the same category for list 1 and list 2?
Which was higher? Why might you still have had them grouped in list 1? (10 PTS)
- Q4: Is the performance and pattern of data better understood as an effect of episodic memory, semantic memory, or both?
Explain. (5 PTS)
