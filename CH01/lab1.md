# Lab 1

This lab involves a simulation of an organism, whose behavior you will try to understand.

   - To run the simulation first you will need to install python on your computer, 
following the instructions here: [Intalling Python](https://github.com/jonwillits/python_for_bcs/blob/master/ebook/CH00/0.0.%20Installing%20Python.md)

   - Then download the program located here: [Braitenberg's Vehicles #2](https://github.com/jonwillits/intro_to_bcs/blob/master/CH1/vehicles.py)

In this simulation, you will imagine you are a scientist who has discovered a new organism. 
You are interested in trying to understand its behavior.
When you load the simulation, you will see some and orange circles that represent heat sources. 
The turtle-shaped entities are the organism that you are studying.
You can press the start button to begin and pause the simulation. 
If you want to observe a new sample, you can press the “Reset” button.
Note that you can click on and move the heat sources around to observe their effect on the organisms.

1. Watch the simulation independently for a few minutes and then jot down your thoughts about what is happening. 
After observing the behavior and developing hypotheses about their behavior, answer the following questions:
   - Briefly describe what your group thought was happening. What were your first impressions about how the organism was behaving?


2. Recall from this week's readings, we talked about Marr's three levels of analysis. 
   - Define the three levels.
   - In your description of the organism's behavior above, what level of explanation did your description correspond to? Why?
   - For the two levels your description did not match, give an example of the kind of explanation you would need to give
   to explain the organism's behavior at that level.
 
6. Now imagine that you have done a dissection on one of these organisms and discovered the organization of their nervous system that controls their movement.
   It is surprisingly simple, and is shown in the figure below:

   ![Turtle Vehicle Simulation Motor Nervous System](../images/turtle_neuro.png)

   It turns out that the two kinds of turtles have slightly different nervous systems. The blue turtles' nervous system looks like the one on the left. At the front of the organism near the eyes are two neurons that are heat sensitive, one on the left, and one on the right. These neurons project all the way to the back of the organism and stimulate the feet (the boxes on the bottom left and bottom right). As you can see in the picture, the blue organism has what is called "ipsalateral" organization, the sensor on the left is connected to the foot on the left, and the sensor on the right is connected to the foot on the right. The red turtle, shown on the right, has was is called a "contralateral" organization. It is very similar to the blue turtle, except that the left heat sensor is connected to the right foot, and the right heat sensor is connected to the left foot. This means that if a heat source is located ahead and to the middle of the turtles, it will stimulate the heat sensors that are closer to the heat source a little more than the sensors that are further away, causing the connected legs to move faster.

   Discuss the implications of the organization of this nervous system. What does it explain about how and why the organisms behave the way that they do? 
 
8. One of the main themes of this week is that there are many different levels of analysis, and they sometimes provide different answers. You already attempted to describe this organism's behavior at multiple levels of analysis. Now, I want you to reflect on the value of the different levels, by answering the questions below.
   - Do you think the different levels of analysis provide complimentary or contradictory explanations? Your group members may disagree on this question, feel free to document different perspectives.
   - Are some levels of analysis better or more useful than others, at least in certain circumstances? Again, your group may have differing opinions, please share them.
