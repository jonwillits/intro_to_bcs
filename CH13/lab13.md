# Lab 13: Large Language Models (LLMs)

For these first two questions, we'd like you to use one of the popular large language models.
You can opt out of these questions if you have a principled objection to using them. 
If that is the case, please proceed to doing question 1B instead.
If you would like to do the questions involving the models, here are some of the options:

If you have another one you would like to use instead, that's fine. 
Whatever you choose, let us know which one you're using for these two questions.

## 1A. Using Large Langauge Models (28 PTS Total)

### Asking about something you know really well
First, i'd like to have a conversation with the LLM about a topic that you feel like you really know a lot about.
It could be a sport, or a book, or cooking or some other hobby. What is something you know how to do *really* well,
something you're an expert at. Ask the LLM how to do something you already know how to do. 
Ask it at least two follow-up questions asking it to for more details about that thing.

when LLMs are likely or unlikely to be useful. (5 PTS)
